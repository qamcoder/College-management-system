#### Description:  Overview
The College Management System is a web application designed to efficiently manage student records, teacher information, and student attendance. The system provides role-based access for admin teachers, non-admin teachers, and students, ensuring smooth management and tracking of academic data.

Key Features
Admin Teachers:
Add Teachers: Enter teacher details (name, subject, admin status). The system auto-generates their username and password for login.
Add Students: Enter student details (name, roll number). The system auto-generates their username and password for login.
View Teachers Database: Access a structured list of all registered teachers.
View Students Database: Access a structured list of all enrolled students.
Non-Admin Teachers:
Mark Attendance: Record attendance for all students in their assigned subject on the current date.
View Students Database: Access and review student records.
Students:
View Attendance: Access a user-friendly interface to check attendance records and percentage.
System Workflow:
When a user logs in, the system automatically verifies if the daily attendance has been recorded.
If attendance has not been initialized, the system sets all students as absent by default for every subject on that date.
Teachers can later update the attendance status for their respective subjects.
This system enhances efficiency, reduces manual workload, and ensures accurate tracking of attendance and student records
